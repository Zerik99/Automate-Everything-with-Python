# Here is the explanation for the code above:
# 1. The \d{1,3} regex matches one to three digits.
# 2. Since \d matches only one digit, \d{1,3} matches one to three digits.
# 3. The periods need to be escaped with a backslash, so they need to be
#    surrounded with escape characters: \.
# 4. The regex doesnâ€™t match to strings like 4444.11.11.11, because the
#    regex requires that the IP address has exactly three digits and not four digits.
